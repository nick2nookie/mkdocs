# Odoo Versi 16

__2021 was a fantastic year for this project as we shipped many new awesome
features, saw significant user growth and leveraged GitHub Sponsors to make the
project sustainable.__

Today, together, [MkDocs] and Material for MkDocs are among the most popular
options when it comes to choosing a static site generator and theme for your
technical documentation project. Material for MkDocs ensures that your
content is always perfectly presented to your audience, regardless of screen
resolution or device capabilities. It has evolved to a framework for technical
writing, offering many features, some of which are yet to be found in other
static site generators. However, we're far from the end, as 2022 is going to
bring some interesting new capabilities.
